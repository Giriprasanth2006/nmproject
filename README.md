# Air Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict air quality levels using advanced machine learning algorithms, helping provide actionable environmental insights. By analyzing historical air pollution and weather data, the model forecasts pollution levels such as PM2.5 and AQI, supporting better public health decisions and environmental planning.

## 🚩 Objectives
- Predict air quality index (AQI) and pollutant concentrations using ML models
- Identify key factors influencing air quality
- Enable real-time and location-based air quality forecasting in the future

## 🧠 Technologies & Tools
- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, matplotlib, seaborn, tensorflow/keras
